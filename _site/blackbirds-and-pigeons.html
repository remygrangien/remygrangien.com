  <h1>Blackbirds and pigeons</h1>

  <p>In <em>Philosophy of Mind: Body, Brian and Behaviour</em> (Slor et al 2015), I came across a thought experiment, which I paraphrase here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a foggy morning. As you look outside your window, you see a bird sitting on a branch of a tree. You mistake the bird for a blackbird, when it is in fact a pigeon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a kind of conclusion to this argument, the authors state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Once a token of PIGEON in your head has been caused by a blackbird, tokens of the PIGEON type obtain the meaning ‘pigeon-or-blackbird’. The undesirable consequence is that you are not making a mistake when you instantiate a token of PIGEON in response to seeing a blackbird.” (Slor et al. pp.127)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to explore why this is a misleading line of thought, and show why obstructions to conclusions in this area of enquiry may have negative consequences in the intelligences we engineer.</p>

<p>Consider that there are two objects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The present concept of ‘a blackbird’ that you have in your mind.</li>
  <li>The pigeon itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>What is of interest are the questions relating to the connection between these objects, however, to elaborate on the nature of each object:</p>

<p>Regarding object (1), A contemporary understanding of object recognition would say that there are classes of things that exist in your mind. To distinguish either a pigeon or blackbird, you must at least have two classes, which we say is identified with a ‘token’, that being BLACKBIRD and PIGEON. When presented with evidence, in this case visual, the brain simultaneously compares the case between these and other relevant tokens, such that you can produce the answer ‘I see a blackbird’ when asked about it. A token can have more or less features associated with it, and each feature may vary in weight. At a minimum, a token can be a word and word only, e.g. I tell you that there exists an animal ‘alf’ in the world, and having given you no more information, all that you may associate with from your experience in support of the presence of ‘alf ’ is that it is an animal.</p>

<p>Regarding object (2), we might suppose that these objects belong to natural kinds, pigeon and blackbird. Furthermore, these classes may belong to other natural classes, like bird and animal.</p>

<p>I would like to consider the following questions:</p>

<h2 id="a-how-do-we-learn-classes-like-these">(A) How do we learn classes like these?</h2>

<p>There a two ways we can learn to classify pigeons and blackbirds, and they both imply different kinds of normativity.</p>

<p>The first method of learning is unsupervised learning: two seperate tokens, PIGEON and BLACKBIRD, are modelled if differentiating between the two consistently leads to reward in the brain which are not the correct identification of the birds in of itself. If an animal could conceivably identify pigeons from blackbirds, but neither bird plays any role in the life of that animal, then I think it safe to assume that the animal could not distinguish between them reliably, even if the animal were to notice things that were different about the birds when placed next to one another. The differences in features are perceived, but they are not learned, as they do not relate to any reward, and so they do not become a strong part of that animal’s world model.</p>

<p>The second method of learning is supervised learning: two seperate tokens, PIGEON and BLACKBIRD, are modelled if differentiation is rewarding in-of-itself, whether that be sheer curiosity or some social reward. It is the case that this ability corresponds with a capacity for language, that being a level of differentiation that extends to the linguistic domain, i.e. the words ‘blackbird’ and ‘pigeon’, as well as a capacity to connect the token to other linguistic facts and rational deductions, e.g. pigeons are birds, pigeons have cells, pigeons migrate from so and so region, etc.</p>

<p>The broader question is what relationship do external objects have to internal concepts. Here, the specific question is about the connection between the token BLACKBIRD, that is, the conception that the object out there is a BLACKBIRD, and a potential natural kind pigeon, supposing that we are not familiar with that particular pigeon.</p>

<p>How similar or dissimilar is the token to the natural class, and furthermore, natural object in this case?</p>

<h2 id="c-how-does-certainty-in-this-case-the-obscuring-fog-relate-to-our-world-model">(C) How does certainty, in this case the obscuring fog, relate to our world-model?</h2>
<p>It is important to ask why it being a foggy morning changes our understanding of intentionality. If it were not a foggy morning, would we have made the correct judgement? Perhaps, if it wasn’t foggy, some other factor may have distorted our judgment. For instance, if it were too bright, and our eyes had not adjusted to the light, we still might have mistaken the bird. Or perhaps we did not look long enough. Or, perhaps the bird was too far away. What we should decide on is whether there were some conditions after which we would never be wrong about our judgment. For example, if the bird was presented to us in broad daylight, while our vision was perfect, and we could examine it from all angles, and there were no disruptive elements in our visual field etc. etc. Because, if we still might mistake the pigeon for a blackbird, despite being given all the data a blackbird and pigeon could provide (within reason), then we might suppose that we do not know what a pigeon is.</p>

<p>Suppose we do know the difference between a blackbird and pigeon, such that, with the fog removed, we would realise that we had initially mistaken the bird. Did my knowledge of what a pigeon was update in the direction of a blackbird when I made the initial misidentification? I think it is nonsensical to suggest that your understanding of PIGEON updates toward the natural kind blackbird, because to mistake a pigeon for a blackbird means that you were able to identify features that both animals share, but not any that differentiate pigeons from blackbirds. Of course, it could be argued that it is possible to mistake certain pigeon-only and certain black-bird only features as belonging to the external object, after which the brain weighs up the features to make a decision.</p>

<p>Regarding the sensation of confusion: the discomfort when putting on a pair of glasses unsuited to your eyes.</p>

<h2 id="d-how-does-our-reward-model-and-world-model-relate">(D) How does our reward model and world model relate?</h2>

<p>Is there some universal world-model?</p>

<p>Does the world-model influence the reward-model?</p>

<p>What would deleting the limbic system do?</p>

<p>Key point: on top of having a training period (rather than it being a period, it is a transition between learning dominance and stability of model), we do not learn from uncertain examples. For instance, if presented a series of indeterminate foggy photos, and a supervisor who randomly labelled the photos, we would not learn the incorrect kind: we would instead learn nothing.</p>

<p>Second key point: the foundation of intellectual existence is built through unsupervised learning (e.g. sight, movement, etc.); supervised learning comes later (e.g. complex language, mathematics, etc.). Therefore, we should not confuse normativity issues around complex matters like ethical reasoning with normativity issues with things like visual classification, i.e. the ‘objectivity’ of our material world.</p>

<p>Engineering implications.</p>

<p>We should like to understand the stratification of classification in the brain. The reason being, that we would like to understand how inherent different ways of perceiving the world are.</p>
