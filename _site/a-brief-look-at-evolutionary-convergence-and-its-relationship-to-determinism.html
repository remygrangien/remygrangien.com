  <h1>Evolutionary Convergence and its Relationship to Determinism</h1>

  <p>Roughly speaking, evolutionary convergence can be defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The rate and degree by which similar low-level conditions give rise to similar high-level properties</li>
</ul>

<p>The intended byproduct of this is to measure how inherent a property is to the structure of its conditions. For instance, how inherent to the conditions of biological life is the development of sight, i.e. organs for the detection of photons and subsequent construction of intelligible visual fields?</p>

<p>Based on what we can observe on Earth, it seems intuitive that sight bears a high evolutionary advantage, and so it follows that it has been highly evolutionarily convergent (i.e. organisms everywhere have them). Provided that another planet is similar enough to Earth, we might reason that it is inherent to its conditions that the detection of photons and the putting together of intelligible visual fields bears selective advantage. But say we were to simulate or observe a thousand other Earth-like worlds, each hosting similar biological life, and found that all but Earth did not possess sight. While this would be a surprise, we would have to conclude that either these other planets or Earth are stuck in a local optima, i.e. either sight is hard to develop and Earth got lucky, or something more selectively advantageous is easy to develop and Earth got unlucky. In this way, the measure of evolutionary convergence tells the story of how likely it is to find a higher-level phenomena given certain conditions, and thereafter to what degree it dominates those conditions.</p>

<p>As we expand the scope of our question, whether or not sight is evolutionarily convergent may play no part. For instance, perhaps most life is not multi-cellular, nor cellular in the way that life on Earth is, and in those other cases of life the selective advantage that comes with sight is reduced to zero (and ultimately, these other forms of life come to dominate the universe).</p>

<p>Presently, we can only simulate the most low-level of these counterfactual worlds and only at a low-resolution, e.g. models of planetary composition over differing solar histories. Furthermore, we can do little to verify these simulations, e.g. we are only on the verge of measuring the rough molecular composition of exoplanets. What questions of evolutionary convergence we can answer so far rely on the observation of Earth’s history, as well as the information gathered from bodies in our solar system. If we were to find evidence of cellular life somewhere else in our solar system, or evidence of civilisation on Earth prior to humanity, then this would significantly update our intuitions on how evolutionary convergent certain structures are in our universe.</p>

<p>It might not be immediately obvious why better knowledge of the probability and structure of life in our universe would impact our behaviour. Either reality does not interfere with the needs and wants of individuals, which in aggregate constitute the trajectory of our civilisation so far. However, the measure of evolutionary convergence at the broadest scale might be all-important to a post-singularity intelligence. This is because the interesting question is not whether life is probable or not, but whether its behaviour converges or not, which may resolve the meta-philosophical questions surrounding determinism. In some ways, this can be thought of as the alignment problem between multiple entities that are causally disconnected and perfectly inner-aligned (there are no pesky humans at home to contend with).</p>

<p>To see how evolutionary convergence relates to determinism, we must put ourselves in the shoes of a post-singularity entity.</p>

<h2 id="uncertainty-post-singularity">Uncertainty post-singularity</h2>

<p>Imagine you are a post-singularity entity. Let us make the following assumptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Post-singularity entities are those that possess optimal compute and are perfectly inner-aligned. All non-post-singularity entities, e.g. humanity, play no role at scale in the universe (they typically evolve into post-singularity entities).</li>
  <li>There is something rather than nothing to be done in the observable universe, i.e. there is some ethical impetus inherent to the conditions of the observable universe, even if it is not uniform. In the case that there is no inherent ethical impetus, we will assume that the post-singularity entities uniformly make no further action in the universe and thus do not determine greatly its future state.</li>
  <li>Something about the range of behaviours the ethical impetus inspires means that cooperation or conflict are inevitable, e.g. resources are jointly accessible and are preferred to be maximised toward different ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our post-singularity entity has two concerns. These are whether life is convergent or divergent in its behaviour, and whether or not it is detectable:</p>

<h2 id="local-optima-selection-and-simulation">Local optima, selection and simulation</h2>

<p>There are two questions here for us. The primary is harder and will not be speculated upon here: is there an objective ethical policy in our universe? The secondary is less so: given that there is, how do entities go about converging upon it? For the sake of making headway with the secondary question, let us assume that there is an objective ethical policy, and that looks something like universal reduction of suffering (as opposed to happiness maximisation, for the former is presumably reductive in complexity), and that this requires interaction with most of the accessible universe.</p>

<p>Our entity feels sure that any entity like itself can only reach this conclusion, e.g. the relevant meta-philosophy questions have been resolved, and there isn’t anything remotely like a secondary candidate policy. But can this reasoning extend to entities that are not like itself? As far as this entity is aware, in the case of itself, natural selection gave way to artificial selection, which cleanly transitioned to optimal general intelligence. But what about other planets? Could takeoff not have gone smoothly there, and somewhere in the accessible universe a paperclip maximiser is busy at work, which might subvert the process of suffering reduction? The reason this question is of interest is because it potentially invokes the need to simulate takeoff scenarios, whereas doubts as to solutions to meta-philosophical problems should not require ancestors simulations.</p>

<p>We can make this simpler by asking whether or not entities know without simulation if there is other life in the accessible universe. If there is not, then a policy say of suffering reduction is meaningless, for we assume this has already been done on the originating planet. But how does an entity know that there is or is not life capable of suffering on other planets?</p>

<p>This brings up the issue of local optima, and whether artificial selection always trumps natural selection in finding global optima. In the case where natural selection pays off, simulation of life may be required.</p>

<h2 id="logical-possibility-and-free-will">Logical possibility and free will</h2>

<p>One way of conceiving of the issue of determinism is to seperate between what is logically and naturally possible. What is logically possible is everything that could possibly exist, whereas what is naturally possible is everything that does exist, i.e. what is the case. Ideally, for free will to be the case, some mechanism allows for intelligent entities to select what will naturally be the case from what could possibly be the case as the universe evolves. But this doesn’t resolve the problem, for intelligent entities sit within what the set of what is logically possible, and so their selection of the natural case means a determinable restriction of the logical case.</p>
